# Hierarchical Clustering Analysis â€” Individual Assignment

## Files Included:

1. A Jupyter Notebook containing a detailed hierarchical clustering analysis for the assignment. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Distance metric selection
- Linkage method experimentation
- Dendrogram plotting and cluster interpretation
- Use case discussions and visualizations

2. `pricerunner_aggregate.csv`
A cleaned and aggregated dataset used for hierarchical clustering. This dataset contains product data scraped from PriceRunner and aggregated across multiple categories and features.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of hierarchical clustering through practical application on real-world data. The notebook walks through:

- How to choose the right distance metric
- How linkage methods affect clustering outcomes
- Interpreting dendrograms to define clusters
- Use cases across business, healthcare, and tech domains

## Outcome
The notebook generates dendrograms and cluster assignments for product data, and discusses the implications of different clustering strategies.
